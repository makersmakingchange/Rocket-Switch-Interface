# Rocket-Switch-Interface
The Rocket-Switch-Interface is a switch interface device which enables users to operate their computer or smartphone devices using adaptive switches. Rocket-Switch-Interface supports up to two input 3.5mm adaptive switches.

## Usage
Both switches can be used as inputs when short pressed, switch 1 can be used to change the operation mode when it’s pressed and hold for 4 seconds. The device can operate in several modes:

•	Switch Mode: This mode can be used along switch control software available for Windows and Android Operating Systems. Switch 1 outputs A key and switch 2 outputs B key.

•	Switch Mac Mode: This mode can be used along switch control software available for Mac Operating Systems. Switch 1 outputs the 1 key and switch 2 outputs the 2 key.

•	Mouse Mode: This mode can be used to simulate a mouse button click. Switch 1 performs left mouse click and switch 2 performs right mouse click.

•	Settings Mode: The settings mode allows the user to adjust the reaction time between switch presses. There are 10 levels in total and the default reaction level is set to 9. The minimum reaction time is 50ms ( Level 10 ) and maximum reaction time is 500ms ( Level 1 ). Switch 1 decrements the reaction level by 1 level and switch 2 increments the reaction level by 1 level as well.
